# MapReduce vs Spark

## Conclusion

* Spark is said to be faster generally since it makes use of in-memory processing.
* However, here it seems Spark had taken more a little time than Hive (MapReduce).
* The reason could be that each iteration was run as a seperate job.
* However, we can conclude that at least MapReduce may be faster for some use cases.
* In terms of ease of use, both seem to tie
